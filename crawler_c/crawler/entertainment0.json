    "content": "Bernecker's other credits included \"Looper\" and \"Logan.\" He also did some work on the upcoming \"Black Panther\" film. Gimple added that the cast and producers were unsure if they should continue with plans to hold the panel following Bernecker's death, but decided to move forward for the fans. \"We wanted to be here for you and we wanted to tell you about John and we wanted show you what we've all been working on,\" he said. Gimple then unveiled the new five-minute trailer for Season 8 of \"The Walking Dead,\" which ends with a titillating tease of an older Rick Grimes. Executive producer Robert Kirkman said later, \"It's easy to see and safe to report that this season will be very action packed and move at a very fast pace,\" according to audience reports. It had been reported earlier in the day that Kirkman had said he was moving toward the end of \"The Walking Dead\" comics, but he later tweeted to clarify that he only knew how the comics will end. The rest of \"The Walking Dead\" panel was driven by fan questions, as typical moderator and \"Talking Dead\" host Chris Hardwick sat out the proceedings. Hardwick moderated the panel for spin-off \"Fear the Walking Dead\" prior to the panel for the mothership series. Hardwick opened that panel with a moment of silence in honor of Bernecker, according to TV Guide. \"The Walking Dead\" returns Sunday, October 22."
