    "content": "With presidential impeachment hearings, O.J. Simpson's murder trial and the golden age of TV sitcoms, the last 10 years of the 20th century were an unforgettable time for those who lived through them. The '90s were a time of peace and prosperity for many Americans, but the \"last great decade\" also saw the rise of terrorism, genocides and famine in parts of the globe. Here are 90 moments that defined the decade, and in many cases, shaped the world we live in today."
